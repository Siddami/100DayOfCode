# Day 48 100DaysOfCode

## Project: Calculate Object Weight on Different Planets

### Summary
Day 44 of my #100DaysOfCode challenge involved enhancing my understanding of the Document Object Model (DOM) and dynamically manipulating the User Interface using JavaScript. Inspired by my study resources, I developed a project where I built a website with interactive styling entirely through JavaScript. This project also allowed me to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by managing all page data from an object.

## Thought Process

### Problem Understanding
The goal was to create an interactive webpage where users could input the mass of an object, select a planet, and then calculate and display the object's weight on the selected planet using JavaScript.

### Approach
1. **HTML Structure**:
   - Basic form with input for mass and a dropdown for planet selection.
   - A button to trigger the weight calculation.
   - Containers to display results and planet images.

2. **JavaScript Implementation**:
   - **Element Selection**: Used `document.querySelector` to select HTML elements.
   - **Dynamic Styling**: Applied styles to elements using JavaScript.
   - **Event Handling**: Added an event listener to the button to handle the calculation and display logic.
   - **Data Management**: Stored gravitational constants in a dictionary.
   - **Conditional Logic**: Used a switch statement to update the planet image based on the selection.
   - **Calculation and Display**: Calculated the weight and updated the DOM with results.

### Code Highlights
- **Gravitational Constants**: Stored in an object for easy access.
- **Event Listener**: Handles input validation, image update, weight calculation, and display.
- **Styling**: Applied dynamically to ensure a responsive and visually appealing UI.

## Key Learnings
- Enhanced understanding of the DOM and its manipulation using JavaScript.
- Practiced OOP by managing data within objects.
- Gained experience in dynamically generating and styling HTML elements through JS.
