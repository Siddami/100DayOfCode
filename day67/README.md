# Day67 100DaysOfCode

Today i tackled an Exercism challenge called "Lucian's Luscious Language" .

where i tackled a few challenges based on my understanding of 'functions', 'imports', and other opertaions in Javascript

## Key Takeaways

1. JavaScript Basics: Reinforced my understanding of imports and exports, functions, and mathematical operators in Javascript.

2. Problem-Solving: I Practiced breaking down complex problems into manageable steps.

3. Code Efficiency: I also Focused on writing clean and efficient code.(probably not the cleanest because I am not at my best ðŸ˜¤ )
