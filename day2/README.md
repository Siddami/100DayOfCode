## Overview
On day 2 of the 100 Days of Code challenge, I focused on learning and practicing various JavaScript string methods, parsing methods, math functions, and regular expression functions and characters.

## Key Takeaways
- Gained understanding of essential string methods like `toUpperCase()`, `toLowerCase()`, and `substr()`.
- Learned how to use `parseInt()`, `parseFloat()`, `length`, and `includes()`.
- Practiced using various math functions in JavaScript.
- Explored regular expression functions such as `replace()` and `match()`.
- Understood the usage of regular expression characters like `g` (global) and `i` (case insensitive).
- Learned about escape characters such as `\` and `\n`.

## Things I Did
1. Practiced using string methods (`toUpperCase()`, `toLowerCase()`, `substr()`).
2. Worked with parsing methods like `parseInt()` and `parseFloat()`.
3. Utilized the `length` and `includes()` methods.
4. Experimented with various math functions.
5. Implemented regular expression functions (`replace()`, `match()`).
6. Learned and used regular expression characters (`g`, `i`).
7. Understood and applied escape characters (`\`, `\n`).

## Things I Need to Do
- Continue practicing string methods to gain more proficiency.
- Explore additional parsing methods and their use cases.
- Deepen understanding of math functions and their applications.
- Further practice with regular expressions and their various functions.
- Experiment with more complex regular expressions.
- Review escape characters and their importance in JavaScript.
