## Overview
Day 9 of the 100 Days of Code challenge involved learning and practicing various types of JavaScript functions including anonymous functions, arrow functions, and understanding function parameters.

## Key Takeaways
- Mastered the creation and use of different types of functions: regular, anonymous, and arrow functions.
- Gained understanding of how to pass and handle function parameters.
- Practiced solving real-world problems using functions.

## Things I Did
1. **Functions and Anonymous Functions**
   - Implemented linear and quadratic equation solvers using functions.
   - Created a function to print array elements.
   - Showed the current date and time using the `Date` object.
2. **Arrow Functions**
   - Swapped values using an arrow function.
   - Reversed and capitalized arrays.
   - Added and removed items from arrays.
   - Summed numbers, odd numbers, and even numbers in a range.
3. **Additional Function Practices**
   - Counted evens and odds in a set of numbers.
   - Generated random user IP and MAC addresses.
   - Generated random hexadecimal numbers and user IDs.
4. **Level 3 Challenges**
   - Created an RGB color generator and arrays of hex/RGB colors.
   - Converted between hexadecimal and RGB colors.
   - Shuffled arrays, calculated factorials, and validated variable names.
   - Checked array items for uniqueness and data type consistency.
   - Generated arrays of unique random numbers.
   - Reversed a list of country names.

## Things I Need to Do
- Continue practicing more complex functions and use cases.
- Explore advanced function concepts such as closures and currying.
- Integrate the learned functions into larger, more comprehensive projects.
- Keep solving real-world problems to solidify understanding.
- Review and refactor the existing code to improve readability and performance.
