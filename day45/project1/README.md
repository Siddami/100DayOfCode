# Day 45 100DaysOfCode

## Project Overview
This project was part of my #100DaysOfCode challenge, specifically focusing on DOM manipulation and JavaScript. The goal was to create an interactive webpage that dynamically styles elements and generates content based on user input.

## Thought Process and Approach

### Initial Setup
1. **Selecting and Styling Elements**:
   - I started by selecting the main elements: header, h1, p, and elements with class names.
   - Applied various styles such as text alignment, font family, margins, and colors to create a visually appealing header section.

2. **Input Container**:
   - Selected the input container and its elements (label, input, button).
   - Styled the container to be centered and elements to be aligned and spaced properly.

### Functionality
1. **Creating a Wrapper**:
   - Created a div container (`numWrapper`) for displaying the numbers.
   - Styled it to flex-wrap and align the contents neatly.

2. **Prime Number Function**:
   - Implemented a function `isPrime(num)` to check if a number is prime.

3. **Appending Numbers**:
   - Created an `append` function to generate numbers up to the input value.
   - Each number is styled differently based on whether it is even, prime, or neither.
   - Numbers are appended to `numWrapper` and displayed on the webpage.

4. **Event Handling**:
   - Added an event listener to the button to trigger the `append` function.
   - Added an event listener to the input to clear the `numWrapper` and label text when the input changes.

### Key Learning Points
- Mastered DOM manipulation to dynamically create and style elements.
- Practiced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by managing data through objects.
- Enhanced understanding of event handling in JavaScript.

### Summary
In this exercise, I created a project where I dynamically built a styled webpage using only JavaScript. I managed data using objects, practiced DOM manipulation, and implemented event handling to create an interactive user experience.
