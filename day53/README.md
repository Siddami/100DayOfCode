# World Countries List

## Overview
This project showcases a dynamic and interactive way to display a list of countries using JavaScript to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM). The entire webpage is built using JavaScript, practicing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and enhancing user interactivity without hardcoding HTML elements.

## How I Tackled This Exercise
### Day 53 of #100DaysOfCode

### Thought Process and Implementation
1. **Setup and Initialization**: 
    - Selected HTML elements using `querySelector` for dynamic manipulation.
    - Counted the total number of countries and displayed it in an `h4` element.

2. **Sorting and Displaying Countries**:
    - Sorted the countries alphabetically.
    - Added an event listener to the "All Sorted" button to display all countries when clicked, applying dynamic styles to each country element using JavaScript.

3. **Filtering Countries**:
    - Implemented functionality for the "Start With" button to filter countries that start with a specific letter input by the user.
    - Implemented functionality for the "Search With Any Word" button to filter countries containing any part of the input string.

4. **Dynamic Styling**:
    - Applied CSS styles dynamically via JavaScript to enhance user experience and interactivity.
    - Reset styles and content when the input field loses focus to maintain a clean interface.

### Key Learning Points
- **DOM Manipulation**: Creating and styling HTML elements dynamically using JavaScript.
- **Event Handling**: Using event listeners to trigger actions based on user interactions.
- **OOP Practice**: Managing data and functionality in an organized and modular way using JavaScript objects.
