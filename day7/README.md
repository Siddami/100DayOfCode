## Overview
On day 7 of the 100 Days of Code challenge, I focused on understanding arrays and practicing various array methods in JavaScript.

## Key Takeaways
- Gained a solid understanding of how arrays work in JavaScript.
- Learned and practiced essential array methods such as `concat()`, `splice()`, `pop()`, `split()`, `push()`, `includes()`, `sort()`, and `indexOf()`.

## Things I Did
1. Studied the basic concepts and uses of arrays.
2. Practiced using the `concat()` method to merge arrays.
3. Used the `splice()` method to add and remove elements from arrays.
4. Implemented the `pop()` method to remove the last element of an array.
5. Experimented with the `split()` method to convert strings into arrays.
6. Applied the `push()` method to add new elements to arrays.
7. Utilized the `includes()` method to check for the presence of elements in arrays.
8. Practiced sorting arrays using the `sort()` method.
9. Found the index of elements using the `indexOf()` method.

## Things I Need to Do
- Continue practicing array methods to gain more proficiency.
- Explore additional array methods and their use cases.
- Implement array methods in more complex projects and scenarios.
- Review and deepen understanding of array manipulation and its importance in JavaScript.
