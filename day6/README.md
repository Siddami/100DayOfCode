## Overview
On day 6 of the 100 Days of Code challenge, I focused on understanding and practicing arrays and their various methods in JavaScript. This included learning how to manipulate arrays using different built-in functions.

## Key Takeaways
- Gained a solid understanding of arrays and their structure.
- Learned and practiced array methods including `concat()`, `splice()`, `pop()`, `split()`, `push()`, `includes()`, `sort()`, and `indexOf()`.

## Things I Did
1. Studied the basics of arrays in JavaScript.
2. Practiced using the `concat()` method to combine arrays.
3. Used the `splice()` method to add or remove elements from arrays.
4. Learned how to use the `pop()` method to remove the last element from an array.
5. Practiced using the `split()` method to convert strings into arrays.
6. Used the `push()` method to add elements to the end of an array.
7. Learned and applied the `includes()` method to check for the presence of an element in an array.
8. Practiced sorting arrays using the `sort()` method.
9. Used the `indexOf()` method to find the index of a specific element in an array.

## Things I Need to Do
- Continue practicing with arrays to enhance my understanding and efficiency.
- Explore more advanced array methods and their applications.
- Implement array methods in various coding challenges to solidify my knowledge.
- Experiment with combining multiple array methods in complex scenarios.
- Review and practice array manipulation in different coding environments.
