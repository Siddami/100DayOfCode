# Exercise Report: Set and Map Operations

This report summarizes a series of operations performed on sets and maps.

1. **Empty Set Creation:** An empty set named `emptySet` is created.

2. **Set Creation with Loop:** A set named `numberSet` containing numbers from 0 to 10 is created using a loop.

3. **Element Removal from Set:** An element (10) is removed from the `numberSet`.

4. **Set Clearing:** The `numberSet` is cleared, resulting in an empty set.

5. **Set Creation from Array:** A set named `stringsSet` is created containing 5 unique string elements from an array, `arrayOfStringElement`. The set is then logged along with its size.

6. **Map Creation from Array:** A map named `mapOfCountries` is created from an array of country names, where each country is mapped to its length in characters.

These operations demonstrate fundamental functionalities of sets and maps in JavaScript.
