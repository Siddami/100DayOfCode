## Overview
On Day One, I focused on foundational JavaScript concepts and syntax. This included learning about comments, operators, and variable handling.

## Key Takeaways
1. **Inline Comments**: Using `//` for single-line comments.
2. **Multiline Comments**: Using `/**/` for block comments.
3. **`typeof()` Operator**: Understanding how to check data types.
4. **`console.log()`**: Utilizing the console for output.
5. **Variables**: Basics of variable usage and importance.
6. **Variable Declaration**: Different methods to declare variables.
7. **Syntax Rules**: Basic rules for writing correct JavaScript code.

## Things I Did
- Studied the concept of inline comments and practiced using `//`.
- Learned about multiline comments and implemented them with `/**/`.
- Explored the `typeof()` operator and its applications.
- Used `console.log()` for printing output to the console.
- Understood variables and their significance in JavaScript.
- Practiced different ways of variable declaration (var, let, const).
- Reviewed and adhered to JavaScript syntax rules.

## Things I Need to Do
- Continue practicing with more JavaScript exercises.
- Deepen understanding of variable scope and hoisting.
- Explore additional operators and their use cases.
- Start working on small projects to apply learned concepts.
