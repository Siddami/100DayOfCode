1. **Destructuring Countries Data:** Used destructuring to print the name, capital, population, and languages of all countries in an array of objects.

2. **Student Data Destructuring:** Destructured an array to extract the student's name, skills, and specific scores into separate variables.

3. **Array to Object Conversion:** Created a function `convertArrayToObject` that converts an array of student data into an array of objects.

4. **Immutable Object Copy and Update:** Copied a `studentInfo` object to `newStudent` without mutation, and updated `newStudent` with additional skills in various categories.

5. **Updated Skill Sets:** Added new skills to the `frontEnd`, `backEnd`, `dataBase`, and `dataScience` categories in the `newStudent` object.
