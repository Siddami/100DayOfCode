## Overview
On day 3 of the 100 Days of Code challenge, I tackled various tasks to deepen my understanding of truthy and falsy values, the Date object, the `prompt()` function, math methods, concatenation, template literals, and additional string methods.

## Key Takeaways
- Recognized the importance and usage of truthy and falsy values in JavaScript.
- Explored the Date object and its methods, such as `getDay()`.
- Utilized the `prompt()` function for user input.
- Practiced more advanced math methods.
- Learned how to effectively use concatenation.
- Embraced the use of template literals for string interpolation.
- Applied other string methods, including `slice()`.

## Things I Did
1. Studied and identified truthy and falsy values.
2. Worked with the Date object and various methods like `getDay()`.
3. Used the `prompt()` function to gather user input.
4. Practiced and applied additional math methods.
5. Performed string concatenation in different scenarios.
6. Implemented template literals for cleaner code.
7. Utilized string methods such as `slice()` to manipulate strings.

## Things I Need to Do
- Continue practicing with truthy and falsy values to solidify understanding.
- Experiment with more methods of the Date object.
- Explore different use cases of the `prompt()` function.
- Delve deeper into advanced math methods and their practical applications.
- Practice more complex concatenation scenarios.
- Use template literals in various coding projects.
- Explore and utilize more string methods to enhance string manipulation skills.
